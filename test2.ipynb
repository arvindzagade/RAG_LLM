      "Biomedical Image Analysis is helpful in drug discovery as it can expedite and improve the accuracy of various stages of the drug development process. According to the research papers provided, it can be used to analyze large datasets and intricate biological networks for therapeutic target discovery, which can reduce the time it takes for traditional target identification from years to decades (Pun et al., 2021). Furthermore, AI-powered image analysis can facilitate rapid development of pharmaceutical research by providing insights into disease modeling and drug response (Kolluri, 2021). Additionally, the use of image analysis in drug discovery can help industrialize the process, as demonstrated by the Patrimony computing platform, which has successfully integrated AI-powered image analysis into drug discovery (Guedj et al., 2022). Therefore, biomedical image analysis has the potential to significantly improve the efficiency and effectiveness of drug discovery.\n"
